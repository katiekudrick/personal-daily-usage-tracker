# personal-daily-usage-tracker

12.29.22
In an effort to track my overall spending, prevent impulse purchases, and realize the value in investing in high-quality items that may cost more but last longer, I decided to track my cost per use for my wardrobe pieces and skincare, haircare, and make-up products. Originally, I was going to do this in an Excel file. 

However, since I am learning to code, I decided instead to turn this into a web application. And, since I am still learning, I am using ChatGPT to assist me in my intial code. My first commits will be the code that comes from ChatGPT. It will be noted when I begin to edit the code to make it my own. 

I will be using Bootstrap, React, and Flask in this application. I have been learning Python lately and wanted to use it in a full-stack application for the first time.
